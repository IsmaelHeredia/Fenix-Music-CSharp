# Fenix Music

It is a program to play music and streams made in C# with Telerik. It uses SQLite as database for configuration.

Functions :

* The program interprets the folders of the Music directory of the system as Playlists, when starting the program they can decide if they generate the playlists at that moment or later in another directory.

* You can search for music and playlists by name, to confirm the search you have to use the enter key.

* Stations can be added, edited and deleted.

* It can be configured so that it asks if it is necessary to generate the playlists at the beginning of the program. You can also configure and save the directory that contains the playlists.

* It can be configured so that hotkeys are detected and program playback can be controlled.

* You can import, export, validate the stations. They have to be in json format like the stations.json file included in the program.

The hotkeys are the following:

* F5 : Stop

* F6 : Previous song

* F7 : Play / Pause

* F8 : Next song

* F9 : Enable / Disable repeat song
